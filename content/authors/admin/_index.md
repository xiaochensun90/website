I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at New Mexico State University. My research interests lie in the field of energy and environmental economics and policy. I apply economic and econometric models to examine the impacts of a wide range of policies, including building efficiency, air pollution, and electricity markets. I completed my Ph.D. in Public Policy and Management from Carnegie Mellon University. Before my Ph.D., I worked as a research analyst at the Duke University Energy Initiative. I hold a B.A. in Environmental Economics from Renmin University of China and an M.S. in Environmental Economics and Policy from Duke University.
